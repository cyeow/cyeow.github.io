  abstract  = {The traditional wastewater management concept (urban wastewater collection system plus treatment of the wastewater in a central treatment plant) has been successfully applied over many decades in densely populated areas of industrialized countries. Whether this technology is of ultimate wisdom must be questioned, especially considering the urgent need for improved sanitary infrastructures in developing countries. The problem is that the costs for implementing a centralized system in mega-cities, in particular the investment costs for the sewer system, are exorbitant. Decentralized wastewater management systems, with the wastewater treated close to where it is generated, are being considered by various researchers and institutions including the World Bank as an alternative to the traditional centralized system. The degree of technological sophistication that should be applied is under dispute, however. In this paper, we advocate development and application of high-tech on-site treatment plants, designed and fabricated by modern industrial methods. When mass produced, the costs for manufacturing such package plants can presumably be kept at a relatively low level. The plants should be delivered in a {\textquotedblleft}user ready{\textquotedblright} state. Local plumbers may connect toilet bowls and sinks and washing machines, but may not be involved in the manufacturing of the treatment system. The plant should produce an effluent which is hygienically safe and can subsequently be utilized for toilet flushing, washing clothes, cleaning floors or watering lawns. In order to keep the plants operating properly, they should controlled by remote sensing, and maintained by specialized service enterprises. The conceptual design of such a compact plant is discussed in the form of a case study.},

  abstract  = {Sewerage system and centralised aerobic wastewater treatment plants (WTP) should not be considered as the only possible solution for sanitation. Systems with source control can avoid many problems of the end-of-pipe technology by respecting different qualities of wastewater and by treating them appropriately for reuse.Different qualities of waste and wastewater in human settlements and appropriate treatment technologies can be: 1. low diluted faeces with/without urine and bio waste (composter or anaerobic digester), 2. grey {\textperiodcentered}water/aerobic biofilm plant, 3. storm water (usage and infiltration) and 4. non-biodegradable waste (reuse as raw material). In order to perform resource management, the material originating from agriculture should be returned to the soil as fertiliser. Of similar importance is the organic material. This helps maintaining or building up humus and creates a sink for carbon when the C-content in the soil is increased. Energy will be saved, too: energy-intensive aerobic treatment with nitrification is obsolete as well as the production of the respective amount of replaced artificial fertiliser. A pilot project for a new settlement for about 300 inhabitants in L{\"u}beck, Germany, shall demonstrate the feasibility of a new integrated system with vacuum toilets and pipes for the collection of black water. This will be mixed with shredded bio waste and fed to a semicentralised biogas plant that produces liquid fertiliser without dewatering. Grey water will be treated in decentralised biofilm systems. Storm water is collected, retained and infiltrated in a trench system. This way the expensive centralised sewerage system can be avoided for this settlement.},
