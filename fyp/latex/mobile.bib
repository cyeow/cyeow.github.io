  abstract  = {The traditional wastewater management concept (urban wastewater collection system plus treatment of the wastewater in a central treatment plant) has been successfully applied over many decades in densely populated areas of industrialized countries. Whether this technology is of ultimate wisdom must be questioned, especially considering the urgent need for improved sanitary infrastructures in developing countries. The problem is that the costs for implementing a centralized system in mega-cities, in particular the investment costs for the sewer system, are exorbitant. Decentralized wastewater management systems, with the wastewater treated close to where it is generated, are being considered by various researchers and institutions including the World Bank as an alternative to the traditional centralized system. The degree of technological sophistication that should be applied is under dispute, however. In this paper, we advocate development and application of high-tech on-site treatment plants, designed and fabricated by modern industrial methods. When mass produced, the costs for manufacturing such package plants can presumably be kept at a relatively low level. The plants should be delivered in a {\textquotedblleft}user ready{\textquotedblright} state. Local plumbers may connect toilet bowls and sinks and washing machines, but may not be involved in the manufacturing of the treatment system. The plant should produce an effluent which is hygienically safe and can subsequently be utilized for toilet flushing, washing clothes, cleaning floors or watering lawns. In order to keep the plants operating properly, they should controlled by remote sensing, and maintained by specialized service enterprises. The conceptual design of such a compact plant is discussed in the form of a case study.},

  abstract  = {This book fills a gap in the literature by providing an extensive, worldwide overview of wastewater treatment via constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs). Special attention is paid to assessing the use of this treatment technology in individual countries and treatment performance of various HF CWs with respect to major pollutants in different types of wastewater. The book provides a broad base of knowledge, including: processes occurring in wetland soils and overlying water, various types of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, detailed information about design parameters, functioning, operation and maintenance, and costs of HF CWs, evaluations of treatment efficiency of HF CWs under diverse conditions, and information on the global use of HF CWs for various types of wastewater. Case studies from over 50 countries and more than 250 colour photos that illustrate the science make this an invaluable text.;Wetlands have been used for uncontrolled wastewater disposal for centuries. However, the change in attitude towards wetlands during the 1950s and 1960s caused the minimization of the use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment (at least in developed countries). Constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment for about forty years. Constructed wetland treatment systems are engineered systems that have been designed and constructed to utilize the natural processes for removal of pollutants. They are designed to take advantage of many of the same processes that occur in natural wetlands, but do so within a more controlled environment. The aim of this book is to summarize the knowledge on horizontal s- surface flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) and objectively evaluate their treatment efficiency under various conditions. The information on this type of wastewater treatment technology is scattered in many publications but a comprehensive summary based on world-wide experience has been lacking. The book provides an extensive overview of this treatment technology around the world, including examples from more than 50 countries and examples of various types of wastewater treated in HF CWs.;Constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs) have been used for wastewater treatment for more than four decades. HF CWs are used around the world for many types of wastewater, including municipal sewage, agricultural and industrial wastewaters, runoff waters, wastewaters containing endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and landfill leachate. This book fills a gap in the literature by providing an extensive, worldwide overview of this treatment technology. Special attention is paid to assessing the use of this treatment technology in individual countries and treatment performance of various HF CWs with respect to major pollutants in different types of wastewater. The book provides a broad base of knowledge, including: processes occurring in wetland soils and overlying water various types of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment detailed information about design parameters, functioning, operation and maintenance, and costs of HF CWs evaluations of treatment efficiency of HF CWs under diverse conditions information on the global use of HF CWs for various types of wastewater The inclusion of case studies from over 50 countries and more than 250 colour photos that illustrate the science makes this an invaluable text.
