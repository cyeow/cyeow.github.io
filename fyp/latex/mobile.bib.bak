  abstract  = {The traditional wastewater management concept (urban wastewater collection system plus treatment of the wastewater in a central treatment plant) has been successfully applied over many decades in densely populated areas of industrialized countries. Whether this technology is of ultimate wisdom must be questioned, especially considering the urgent need for improved sanitary infrastructures in developing countries. The problem is that the costs for implementing a centralized system in mega-cities, in particular the investment costs for the sewer system, are exorbitant. Decentralized wastewater management systems, with the wastewater treated close to where it is generated, are being considered by various researchers and institutions including the World Bank as an alternative to the traditional centralized system. The degree of technological sophistication that should be applied is under dispute, however. In this paper, we advocate development and application of high-tech on-site treatment plants, designed and fabricated by modern industrial methods. When mass produced, the costs for manufacturing such package plants can presumably be kept at a relatively low level. The plants should be delivered in a {\textquotedblleft}user ready{\textquotedblright} state. Local plumbers may connect toilet bowls and sinks and washing machines, but may not be involved in the manufacturing of the treatment system. The plant should produce an effluent which is hygienically safe and can subsequently be utilized for toilet flushing, washing clothes, cleaning floors or watering lawns. In order to keep the plants operating properly, they should controlled by remote sensing, and maintained by specialized service enterprises. The conceptual design of such a compact plant is discussed in the form of a case study.},

Special attention is paid to assessing the use of this treatment technology in individual countries and treatment performance of various HF CWs with respect to major pollutants in different types of wastewater. The book provides a broad base of knowledge, including: processes occurring in wetland soils and overlying water, various types of constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, detailed information about design parameters, functioning, operation and maintenance, and costs of HF CWs, evaluations of treatment efficiency of HF CWs under diverse conditions, and information on the global use of HF CWs for various types of wastewater. Case studies from over 50 countries and more than 250 colour photos that illustrate the science make this an invaluable text.;Wetlands have been used for uncontrolled wastewater disposal for centuries. However, the change in attitude towards wetlands during the 1950s and 1960s caused the minimization of the use of natural wetlands for wastewater treatment (at least in developed countries). Constructed wetlands have been used for wastewater treatment for about forty years. Constructed wetland treatment systems are engineered systems that have been designed and constructed to utilize the natural processes for removal of pollutants. They are designed to take advantage of many of the same processes that occur in natural wetlands, but do so within a more controlled environment. The aim of this book is to summarize the knowledge on horizontal s- surface flow constructed wetlands (HF CWs) and objectively evaluate their treatment efficiency under various conditions. The information on this type of wastewater treatment technology is scattered in many publications but a comprehensive summary based on world-wide experience has been lacking. The book provides an extensive overview of this treatment technology around the world, including examples from more than 50 countries and examples of various types of wastewater treated in HF CWs.;Constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow (HF CWs) have been used for wastewater treatment for more than four decades. HF CWs are used around the world for many types of wastewater, including municipal sewage, agricultural and industrial wastewaters, runoff waters, wastewaters containing endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and landfill leachate.

Accessing, sharing, and managing energy and material resources is particularly critical for megacities, which face enormous social stresses because of their sheer size and complexity. Here we quantify the energy and material flows through the world's 27 megacities with populations greater than 10 million people as of 2010. Collectively the resource flows through megacities are largely consistent with scaling laws established in the emerging science of cities. Correlations are established for electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of heating-degree-days, urban form, economic activity, and population growth. The results help identify megacities exhibiting high and low levels of consumption and those making efficient use of resources. The correlation between per capita electricity use and urbanized area per capita is shown to be a consequence of gross building floor area per capita, which is found to increase for lower-density cities. Many of the megacities are growing rapidly in population but are growing even faster in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and energy use. In the decade from 2001-2011, electricity use and ground transportation fuel use in megacities grew at approximately half the rate of GDP growth.;sustainability | sustainable development | urbanization | urban metabolism | industrial ecology;  Understanding the drivers of energy and material flows of cities is important for addressing global environmental challenges.

In more recent years privatised water authorities, seeking to maximise consumption and profits, have reinforced the emphasis on increasing supply. Now the cities must cope with the stresses these policies have imposed on the eco-systems from which they harvest water, into which they discharge wastes, and on which they are located. Residents are having to pay more for their water, while the cities themselves are becoming less sustainable. Must we build more dams and desalination plants, or should we be managing the demand for urban water more prudently? This book explores the demand for urban water and how it has changed in response to shifting social mores over the past century. It explains how demand for centralised provision of water might be reshaped to enable the cities to better cope with expected changes in supply as our climate changes. And it discusses the implications of property rights in water for proposals to privatise water services.},

  abstract = {'Water is a brutal delineator of social power which has at various times worked to either foster greater urban cohesion or generate new forms of political conflict'. In the paper which follows, Matthew Gandy explores this statement by looking at the expansion of urban water systems since the chaos of the nineteenth-century industrial city. In this early period, the relationship between water and urban space can be understood by the emergence of what he calls the 'bacteriological city', defined by features such as new moral geographies and modes of social discipline based upon ideologies of cleanliness, a move away from laissez-faire policies towards a technocratic and rational model of municipal managerialism, and a connection between urban infrastructures and citizenship rights. Gandy goes on to discuss that while many cities never ultimately conformed to this model, the last thirty years has seen a fundamental move away from the bacteriological city to a more diffuse, fragmentary and polarized urban technological landscape. Characteristics here include declining investment in urban infrastructures, a desire to meet shareholder rather than wider public needs, oligopolistic structures amongst providers, the marketisation of goods such as water, increased health scares and mistrust from consumers, and polarisation of the quality of service provision. For Gandy, these shifts are better understood by more relational, hybridised, rather than functional-linear, notions of urban metabolic systems.},
